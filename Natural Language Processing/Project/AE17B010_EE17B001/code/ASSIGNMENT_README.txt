Please look at the following guidelines to navigate through the project.

1) Run main_lsa.py for LSA, LDA, Word2Vec. Run main_wsd.py for unsupervised WSD. (separate improvements on baseline)
2) Run wsd.py to generate disambiguated_docs.txt and disambiguated_queries.txt. However, this needs stopword_removed_docs.txt and stopword_removed_queries.txt in the output/ folder.
